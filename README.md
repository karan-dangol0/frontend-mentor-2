## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

1. I had fun time playing with flex box.

### Continued development

I feel like I can do this project easily but still it has taken around 2 hrs to finish this project so I continue to refine my skills like grid and flex box.

### Useful resources

I haven't use any resources for this project;
